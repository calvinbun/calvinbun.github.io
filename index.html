        <div class="modal-card">

        </div>
        <div class="modal-card">
      <p>The inspiration behind "WatchDog" came from a personal experience with my own dog, Hobbes, who loved to chase after squirrels and often wandered too far from home. This sparked an idea: to create an affordable and effective pet tracker that could help pet owners everywhere feel secure about their pets' safety. Leading the project at MIT’s Beaver Works Summer Institute, I started by collaborating with my team to outline the tracker’s core functions and plan our approach step-by-step. We began by sketching circuit schematics and designing the PCB layout using Fritzing, with a focus on keeping the design energy-efficient and reliable. My role involved both leading and contributing hands-on by programming in C++ and optimizing Arduino circuitry, aiming to extend battery life while ensuring accurate GPS and radio transmission.
        <br><br>
        The process wasn’t without challenges. One major obstacle was balancing energy efficiency with real-time tracking capabilities. Initially, our device consumed too much power, but by experimenting with power distribution and refining our code, we managed to reduce the energy draw significantly. Additionally, ensuring seamless communication between GPS modules and the radio transmitter required multiple trials, adjustments, and teamwork to resolve connectivity issues. Each obstacle taught us the importance of testing and iteration.
        <br><br>
        Through WatchDog, I gained practical experience in microelectronics and circuit design, but even more importantly, I learned how to lead a team through setbacks and problem-solving. This project reinforced my commitment to creating technology that serves real needs, and it highlighted the impact of collaboration in bringing ideas to life.</p>

          <p>
            "Companion Catch" was inspired by a deep concern for my grandmother's safety after witnessing her struggle with balance issues. I realized that many elderly individuals live alone or without constant supervision, putting them at risk in the event of a fall. Determined to find a solution, I began designing an AI-powered fall detection system that could monitor and alert loved ones if a fall occurred. This project became "Companion Catch"—a device that combines LSTM neural networks, OpenCV, and Mediapipe Pose to detect falls in real-time and send immediate alerts.
            <br><br>
            Creating Companion Catch was an intensive journey that involved more than 1,000 training videos. I filmed over 600 scenarios of simulated falls and another 400 of everyday movements like walking and sitting to help the model differentiate between normal activities and actual falls. This dataset provided the foundation for training the AI, but the process presented challenges; refining the model to reduce false alerts while ensuring sensitivity required constant testing and adjustments. Each misclassification taught me more about the nuances of human movement and the need for precision in AI algorithms.
            <br><br>
            Seeing Companion Catch work successfully was one of my proudest moments, as I knew the device could provide peace of mind to families. Winning the Congressional App Challenge for this project reinforced my commitment to using AI for real-world impact. Through Companion Catch, I gained invaluable skills in AI development, video data analysis, and neural network programming, but more importantly, I learned how technology can address meaningful, human-centered challenges. This experience drives my ongoing goal to innovate in ways that protect and support those we care about most.

          <p>"Tobot," our autonomous tennis ball collector robot, was born out of the shared frustration my teammate and I felt after repeatedly gathering stray tennis balls during practice. We set out with a vision to build a robot that could tackle this task on its own, a project that quickly grew into an opportunity to apply and expand our engineering skills. Our work began with extensive planning: designing each component in Onshape, prototyping parts with 3D printing, and ensuring every piece fit together seamlessly for functionality and durability. As the lead on the electrical systems, I was responsible for implementing sensors and motors and coding Tobot’s autonomous functions, while my teammate focused on refining the mechanical design.
            <br><br>
            One of our biggest challenges came in creating a smooth navigation system that allowed Tobot to locate, retrieve, and transport tennis balls reliably. Using ROS 2, SLAM, NAV2, Gazebo, and RViz, we spent countless hours testing and adjusting Tobot’s pathfinding abilities in a simulated environment before transitioning to real-world trials. Each test presented new obstacles—Tobot’s motor speed, sensor accuracy, and power usage all had to be balanced carefully. By troubleshooting each of these issues, we gradually achieved a reliable design.
            <br><br>
            Through Tobot, I gained hands-on experience in mechanical, electrical, and software integration, and learned how essential collaboration and persistence are to solving complex engineering problems. Seeing Tobot collect its first tennis ball was deeply satisfying, a tangible reminder of the impact technology can have, even in everyday situations. This project not only strengthened my technical skills but also inspired me to keep building solutions that address real-world challenges.</p>

          <p>Building my own custom FPV (First Person View) drone was a project that combined my love for innovation with my fascination for flight. This idea took shape from countless hours of watching FPV drone racing videos and a desire to create something that could navigate the world from a bird’s-eye view. Starting from scratch, I dove into designing and assembling each component—from the flight controller and ESCs to the camera and video transmitter, all while ensuring they worked in harmony to create a responsive, real-time experience.
            <br><br>
            The process was far from simple. Soldering each connection and configuring the flight controller pushed my technical skills to new levels. Programming and tuning the drone for both stability and speed required meticulous adjustments and patience, especially when initial test flights ended in crashes. Each setback, however, became an opportunity to learn and refine. Troubleshooting the mechanics and electronics taught me how even the smallest misalignment or power imbalance could impact performance.
            <br><br>
            Finally achieving a smooth, stable flight was exhilarating, a rewarding moment that confirmed all the effort had been worth it. This project deepened my understanding of aerodynamics, electronics, and problem-solving under pressure. More than just a technical achievement, building my FPV drone reinforced my passion for hands-on engineering and my drive to turn complex ideas into reality.</p>

      <h2>Design and Fabrication of Triboelectric Nanogenerators in Renewable Energy Applications</h2>

    <div class="modal-body">
      <div class="modal-card-container">
        <div class="modal-card">
          <p>The project to design and fabricate triboelectric nanogenerators stemmed from a desire to harness sustainable energy from unexpected sources. My teammate and I were inspired by the potential to generate electricity through everyday mechanical motions—like footsteps or the wind blowing—using triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Our goal was to create a device that could effectively capture and convert this mechanical energy into usable power, contributing to the global push for renewable energy solutions.
            <br><br>
            From the outset, this project required a methodical approach. We began by selecting and testing various triboelectric-friendly materials, each with unique properties affecting energy output. By collecting and analyzing voltage data and power output from different material combinations, we identified those that produced the highest efficiency. However, optimizing the design posed challenges, as even small changes in material thickness or alignment significantly impacted energy capture. Every obstacle pushed us to delve deeper into the physics of triboelectricity and adapt our design accordingly.
            <br><br>
            Winning the Gold Award in the International Association for the Promotion of Advanced Innovation Competition was an incredible honor, but the journey itself was even more meaningful. Working on this project taught me the importance of perseverance, collaboration, and the power of innovation to drive change. Beyond technical skills, this experience deepened my commitment to developing practical renewable energy solutions that can benefit communities worldwide.</p>
